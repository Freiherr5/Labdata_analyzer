General structure of the data analyser:

The file contains 4 scripts:

BacGrowth.py   --> plots growth of the bacteria
HPLC.py        --> High performance liquid chromatography Data (UV/Vis and conductivity + fractions (optional) to running volume
CDSpec.py      --> Circular dichroism spectrum (elipticity - wavelength)
CDheat.py      --> nomralized protein denaturation graph with the key value T1/2 (Temperature at which the protein sample is 50% denaturated as measurement of protein stability)

Configfiles (.ini) are implemented to configurate base parameters
